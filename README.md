OBSERVATIONS ABOUT THE PROJECT

 This is another project I worked on, and it's all about a dashboard for a Beverage Brand.
   From the dashboard I created, I realized that Coca Cola is the most distributed brand across all 
   customers compared to any other beverage brand. On the other hand, Sprite has low sales because customers are not demanding it like they do with Coca Cola, resulting in low income for the company. However, the performance of the other brands is not bad at all. I used SQL for organizing 
  the data and Power BI for visualization."

  CONCLUSION
     I would like to conclude by suggesting that they should focus on increasing profitability
    from the Sprite brand to improve their overall revenue. Additionally, they could consider 
    adding more beverage brands to their menu to diversify and enhance their
     offerings, which may lead to further improvements."
